# Real Cryptography Implementation - Keygen Branch

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Simplified NostrTools
- Removed the custom `nostr-tools.js` implementation
- Added real `nostr-tools@2` library via CDN: `https://unpkg.com/nostr-tools@2/lib/nostr.bundle.js`
- Updated Content Security Policy in manifest.json to allow unpkg.com

### 2. Updated Key Generation API
- Changed `NostrTools.generatePrivateKey()` → `window.NostrTools.generateSecretKey()`
- Updated to use `window.NostrTools.finalizeEvent()` instead of `finishEvent()`
- Maintained compatibility with existing nip19 encoding/decoding

### 3. Added Proper Data Type Handling
- Added `hexToBytes()` and `bytesToHex()` utility functions
- Handle conversion between Uint8Array (crypto functions) and hex strings (storage)
- Ensure private keys are properly formatted for signing operations

### 4. Key Storage Consistency
- Store private keys as hex strings for compatibility with Chrome storage
- Convert to Uint8Array when needed for cryptographic operations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing stored keys

## Real Cryptography Benefits

✅ **Proper secp256k1 Implementation**: Uses actual elliptic curve cryptography instead of simplified mock functions

✅ **Secure Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random key generation using proper entropy

✅ **Verified Signatures**: Real Schnorr signatures that are compatible with the Nostr network

✅ **NIP-19 Compliance**: Proper bech32 encoding/decoding for npub/nsec formats

✅ **Battle-tested Library**: Uses the widely adopted nostr-tools library used by major Nostr clients

## Testing
- Created `test-keygen.html` for local testing of key generation and signing
- Verified proper API integration with browser bundle
- Ensured compatibility with existing Chrome extension architecture

## Next Steps
This implementation provides real cryptography for:
- Secure key generation
- Message signing and verification  
- Compatible with Nostr protocol standards

The extension now uses production-grade cryptography suitable for real Nostr network interaction.
