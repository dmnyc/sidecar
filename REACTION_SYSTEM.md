# Emoji Reaction System Implementation

## Features Implemented

### 🤙 Default Quick Reaction
- **Replace ❤️ Like** with 🤙 React as default
- **Single click/tap** sends instant 🤙 reaction
- **Visual feedback** - button changes to "🤙 Reacted" with purple styling

### 📱 Long-Press Emoji Picker
- **500ms long-press** opens emoji picker modal
- **Works on desktop** (mouse) and **mobile** (touch)
- **Prevents accidental reactions** during long-press

### 🎨 Rich Emoji Selection
- **16 common reactions** in grid layout:
  - 🤙 ❤️ 😂 😍 🔥 👏 🚀 ⭐ 💯 🙌 👍 👎 😢 😡 🤔 🎉
- **Custom emoji input** - type any emoji or symbol
- **Responsive grid** - 4 columns, touch-friendly sizing

### 🌐 Nostr Protocol Compliance
- **Kind 7 events** (reactions) with proper tagging:
  ```json
  {
    "kind": 7,
    "tags": [
      ["e", "note_id"],
      ["p", "author_pubkey"], 
      ["k", "1"]
    ],
    "content": "🤙"
  }
  ```
- **Cross-client compatibility** - reactions appear in other Nostr clients
- **Proper event signing** - works with both local keys and NIP-07

## User Experience

### Quick Reaction Flow
1. **Click** 🤙 React button → Instantly sends 🤙 reaction
2. **Button updates** to show "🤙 Reacted" with visual confirmation

### Custom Reaction Flow  
1. **Long-press** 🤙 React button → Opens emoji picker
2. **Choose emoji** from grid OR **type custom** emoji
3. **Reaction sent** and button updates with chosen emoji

### Visual Design
- **Modern grid layout** for emoji selection
- **Hover effects** with scale animations
- **Purple accent** theme matching Sidecar branding
- **Compact modal** optimized for sidebar width

## Technical Implementation

### Long-Press Detection
```javascript
// Cross-platform long-press (mouse + touch)
startLongPress() → setTimeout(500ms) → showEmojiPicker()
```

### Event Handling
- **Mouse events**: mousedown, mouseup, mouseleave
- **Touch events**: touchstart, touchend, touchcancel  
- **Keyboard support**: Enter key for custom emoji input

### State Management
- `currentReactionEvent` tracks which note is being reacted to
- `isLongPress` flag prevents double reactions
- Real-time UI updates with CSS class changes
