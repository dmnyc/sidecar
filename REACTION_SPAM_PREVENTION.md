# Reaction Spam Prevention Implementation

## Problem Solved
Prevents users from sending multiple reactions to the same note, reducing spam and improving network efficiency.

## Implementation Details

### ðŸ”’ Reaction Tracking
- **`userReactions` Set** - Tracks event IDs user has already reacted to
- **Per-session tracking** - Cleared on sign out or feed switch
- **Memory efficient** - Uses Set for O(1) lookup performance

### ðŸš« Spam Prevention Logic

```javascript
// Check before sending reaction
if (this.userReactions.has(event.id)) {
  return; // Silently prevent duplicate reaction
}

// Track successful reaction
this.userReactions.add(event.id);
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Feedback

**Before Reacting:**
- Button shows "ðŸ¤™ React" 
- Full opacity, hover effects enabled
- Long-press opens emoji picker

**After Reacting:**
- Button shows "{emoji} Reacted"
- Reduced opacity (60%)
- Cursor changes to "not-allowed"
- No hover effects or interactions
- Event listeners removed

### ðŸ”„ State Management

**Reaction tracking is cleared when:**
- User signs out (`signOut()`)
- Feed is switched (`switchFeed()`) 
- New session starts

**Buttons are disabled when:**
- `setupReactionButton()` detects existing reaction
- `updateReactionButton()` processes successful reaction
- `showEmojiPicker()` blocks already-reacted events

### ðŸ’¡ User Experience

**Prevention Methods:**
1. **Early Detection** - `setupReactionButton()` disables button on load
2. **Runtime Check** - `sendReaction()` validates before sending
3. **UI Blocking** - `showEmojiPicker()` prevents modal opening
4. **Visual Cues** - Disabled styling shows reacted state

**Error Handling:**
- No error messages (silent prevention)
- Graceful degradation if tracking fails
- Console logging for debugging

## Benefits

âœ… **Prevents Spam** - No duplicate reactions to same note  
âœ… **Improves UX** - Clear visual feedback for reacted notes  
âœ… **Reduces Network Load** - Fewer redundant Nostr events  
âœ… **Maintains State** - Tracks reactions across UI updates  
âœ… **Cross-Platform** - Works on desktop and mobile  
âœ… **Memory Efficient** - Lightweight Set-based tracking  

## CSS Styles Added

```css
.note-action.reacted,
.reply-action.reacted {
    opacity: 0.6;
    cursor: not-allowed;
}

.note-action.reacted:hover,
.reply-action.reacted:hover {
    background: [no-change];
    transform: none;
}
```

## Technical Notes

- **Client-side only** - Doesn't prevent reactions from other clients
- **Session-based** - Tracking resets between sessions
- **Event-driven** - Disables buttons dynamically as reactions are sent
- **Performance optimized** - O(1) lookups with Set data structure

The implementation provides effective spam prevention while maintaining a smooth user experience with clear visual feedback.
